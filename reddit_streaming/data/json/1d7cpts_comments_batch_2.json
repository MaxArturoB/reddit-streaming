People need to remember that this isn't a zero-sum game. In this situation AI isn't taking anyone's job because the would-be game producer doesn't have the capital to hire artists, composers, and programmers in the first place. The options are: AI assisted game or no game at all. This is just a small example, there will be innovations that could not exist without AI across many industries.\n\nPeople who think AI art should never be used aren't considering the gargantuan opportunity cost being left on the table because they can't get over their idea of the sacred quality of human creativity or some shit. If you advocate against AI, you are advocating for a higher barrier of entry.\n\nI anticipate a lot of down votes and no replies."

It makes sense that the opposite may have happened bacj then. It may have happened out of ignorance rather than lack of empathy then.\n\nAlso, Artist work in particular has always been mistreated, as businesses have exploited people looking to do art as \u201cart is its own reward\u201d and it\u2019s a \u201cdream job\u201d that\u2019s \u201cjust art\u201d and how hard could it be.\n\nSo many artists build up views and experiences that would eventually lead to supporting blue collar workers then. At least i know i do. And the bad faith work policies that affect them also affect us in a similar way, surely. Advocating for my work\u2019s protection riles up others to do the same\u2026 hopefully. \n\nThere\u2019s always gonna be the entitled asshole here and there in any business sadly though."

The problem is when the tool is providing those benefits by using stolen work, which is already the case with LLMs and how graphic media is so easy to copy-paste steal.\n\nIf a movie studio paid someone to come in and for the business hours and royalties of using their writing/art/voice etc. Skill once, and then replicate it with AI forever then that\u2019s just clean business. Same as scraping the web for open-source material. Or capturing nature which nobody owns.\n\nBut if they take advantage of the voice of a dead actor who signed contracts before ai existed, dismissing their estate. Or steal a photographers work of landscapes. Or scrape the whole web without stopping to provide credit and royalties of all they take\u2026 this is just criminal.
