It would be quicker to take my car to a car wash but I still like washing it myself because it's an excuse to play with the power washer. Or for a more accurate example, I could use modern Adobe software with AI generative fill to edit photos and video, but I'm still here doing matte paintings in an old version of After Effects because I enjoy the process."

Briefly, capitalism has allowed a larger than average number of artists to have careers, but that was a flash in the pan. Should we really be scared about AI replacing the smallest group of entitled laborers? Artists who make a living doing art but don't realize most humans are creative but have to sidetrack their creativity to work a meaningless job make me sick. \n\nThe value of human labor has always mostly come from using our energy to grab and hold objects and walk places and make simple mouth sounds. 99% of intellectual labor humans perform will be replaced by AI in less than 10 years. And yes, they are working tirelessly to perfect robotic movement and handling of objects in physical space, there's really no reason to believe 50% or more of physical human labor will be unnecessary in less than ten years.\n\n\"We can't pay people to sit around and do nothing all day!\" You know who usually says that? Middlemen whose jobs are already superfluous, who spend 70% of their work day sitting on their asses."
