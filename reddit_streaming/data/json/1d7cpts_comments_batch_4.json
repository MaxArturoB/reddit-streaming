Not being inflammatory here, genuinely asking.\n\nAre you saying we\u2019ve had enough convenience? That there\u2019s a point at which we don\u2019t deserve any more? That it\u2019s wrong to advocate for comfort for the regular individual? When a select few can just keep buying yatchs to sit at ports, hogging up land to price gauge middle class, polluting air in private jets just to skip a 40 min car drive? \n\nHave you been convinced that any second of any free time you get should be spent for material gain? Do you feel or have been made to feel guilty by peers or family when you try enjoy your leisure? Some can\u2019t even afford to have free time, as commuting, chores, multiple jobs can suck up your time. And then, seeing people post nudes online and racking in double or triple what you gain is validly off-putting. But if we let us be affected that much, we become susceptible to thinking that some things don\u2019t qualify as \u201cwork\u201d, when really there\u2019s allways some amount of base effort required. This hate can seep in deep, and such stances are hurtful to you and peers in the long term. We should instead advocate that compensation for all be raised, instead of putting others down. \n\nA rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n\nWhat about those in need? A machine/utility accessible for me may not be so to someone in a wheelchair for example. Hell, even in medicine some procedures are outdated for women because studies and healthcare systems where built around men.\n\nThere\u2019s never _not_ a time to improve **wellbeing**. Keypoint distinction wellbeing. AI can\u2019t currently fit in that since AI \u2018s real life consequences (as opposed to just the benefits and progress made in a vacuum that it entails) are overall harmful, even if they are just symptoms of a major problem with the workforce, labour rights and ideals."

It's just useless to do right now, unless you're training a robot to reenact that behavior in real life in the future.\n\nThat said, once we do have accessible robots, it will probably be one of the first things to automate.

Imagine the complexity of an engine. WAY more complex than a laundry folding machine. We figured out the engine decades ago because that's where the money was. \n\nGenerative process is completely different. Its parameters are hard to even conceptualize and the boundaries can expand infinitely. Even though generative art is not great at this point, the fact that ai can do anything close to what it can do is a far greater leap than if it could fold laundry. Its the distance of the leap and how much it incites  imagination that brings in the money. \n\nCreating \"decent\" art is definitely not easier than folding laundry."

That you can't expect utopia at all. There is always a time to try to improve wellbeing, but the key word is TRY. There will be mistakes, there will be things that appear bad but have some benefit, and things that appear good, but have some drawback. AI is trying to improve things.

        "text": "Hmm no, missed it again. My bad, i\u2019ll try be clearer.\n\nSo if we need a lot of work, why are machine and software alike putting many people out of business, and a select few who were already well off in a higher position?\n\nAre these CEOs making so much more work suddenly, that warrants all that profit? This profit they pocket, will it put it to good use, creating more jobs to drive the economy and sustain human expansion? \n\nEasy answer is no, because creating more jobs costs short term expense for not-guaranteed long term gain, while cutting them for the \u201ccool new thing\u201dtm makes short term big bucks.\n\nPeople get fired and funneled into ehatever jobs remain, creating unemployment. Remember \u201cshould\u2019ve learnt coding\u201d? Now that software jobs are looking to grt automated, suddenly you \u201cshould\u2019ve learnt a trade\u201d.\n\nLets imagine forwards a little. What happens when every job is automated? When nobody is _allowed_ to work and be paid? Who buys amazon? Who buys houses? Do we give up and resort to manual labour, growing our own food and building our own houses?\n\nWho pays the machines? Do machines pay taxes for all the overpopulation and ageing people that will add up to the cost of retirement on the working class?\n\nTalking about human expansion and demand, are you aware that we have the resources available to work towards ending world hunger, and leaders choose not to? Insulin is dirt cheap to make and yet it costs a whole lot more to buy. Airline companies are willing to hunt down whistleblowers because it\u2019s cheaper than having the news spread and stocks drop. Can you believe this? That it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d for \u201cthe economy\u201d to have children in factories? And that you should abandon work from home? And work more hours? And if you are unwilling, you should be replaced? And that if you aren\u2019t working you don\u2019t deserve healthcare? \n\nAd infinitum, until lawmakers react, which doesn\u2019t happen as they are lobby-bought. Until legislation is passed, except we are still legally defining what is social media, congress full of old farts. Well, until we strike to hurt profit? Oh, no more bargaining chips as you just get replaced? Or companies wait you out to run out of resources unlike them? Fuck do i have to put a guilliotine on a CEO\u2019s doorstep to be heard?\n\n**What OP meant was any progress we make is misused for the benefit of these gold-hoarding dragons and the detriment of the regular human individual. So no, all things considered it\u2019s not real progress**"

AI is already writing routine news stories, is capable writing classical music, makes graphic art that far exceeds the ability of untrained humans, etc.\n\nAs for the intellectual property problem, Adobe addressed that problem with their Firefly product. Firefly is trained on licensed content only so their users are on safe ground. The other AI models, e.g. ChatGPT, do have some legal risk around this. It will be interesting to see how that plays out."

The labor force adjusted and prosperity increased. I have no interest to going back to 1870 when over half the labor force was in farming. I think that increased mechanization was an improvement. \n\nI took a quick look at the OP's Amazon author profile. She writes a lot of sequel-driven fantasy genre books. I haven't read her books, but if they are pretty formulaic, then they will be vulnerable to being out-competed by AI content.

It is one automated part in a human led chain.\n\nThen the human maybe irons a few shirts, and sorts them into a a closet and dresser in a desired way. None of this requires AI because a human is manually controlling the entire process. Creating a human like automaton that thinks for itself and does every single step along the way in this process is not easy. \n\nI can prove it to you very simply. If it was easy to build an AI controlled robot that made decisions through all of these laundry steps, it would only be a bit more complicated to build an AI machine that can fight and kill human soldiers without direct human input.\n\nEvery major military on earth would be fighting wars with automatons that can think for themselves, react the way that humans do. Hell, even just walk through a desert without falling down. We currently cannot. That is why we use human controlled machines like drones instead. For the same reason we use washing machines, not robot slaves that run through all the steps for us. For the same reason humans are still required to drive their own cars instead of an AI controlling everything while you sit back and relax.\n\nThe amount of demand for an automaton like this is thousands of times more than valuable than an AI that spits out company logos or posters that look nice. It is easier for AI to figure out, that is a fact. We know this because one exists and the other doesn\u2019t. Creating images or coherent pieces of writing is even easier than building a robot complex enough to consistently \u201cwalk around\u201d like a human. One that can navigate its environment without bumping into things, run at high speeds, easily and immediately follow commands.\n\nIt is easier than creating a robot dog that could be used in warfare. Otherwise we would just be letting machine gun mounted AI dogs that respond to commands like a real dog out on the battlefield to fight for us"

Reconcile that we\u2019ll never get utopia, yet still we should walk towards it getting as close as possible without backtracking. Now:\n\nAi in paper does improve things and sound cool. The real case scenario, the context and consequences, is that legislation is not ready to regulate, lawmakers are years behind when it comes to technology, and corporations practice rampant theft and do palpable harm. Whatever benefits its bringing it doesn\u2019t outweigh that harm. Unless of course one is of the select few who are in a position to reap rewards from displacing or stealing other people\u2019s work. Or in a position to enjoy it because the ripples haven\u2019t reached you yet. Or more so, have the resources to withstand that hit when it\u2019s knocking at your door.\n\nI don\u2019t care that orgs new and old are making money, it\u2019s not an indicator of true success from an ethical perspective. The AI train needs slowing down until we get our shit together or it\u2019s gonna cause big problems sooner than we are ready to tackle."
