Its absence might lead to decreased cognitive performance, particularly in tasks that benefit from auditory stimulation.\n      * **Memory**: Music is linked to memory enhancement. Without it, some people might experience a decline in memory retention and recall, especially if they rely on music for mnemonic purposes.\n   * **Physiological Effects**:\n      * **Stress Levels**: Music has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety by lowering cortisol levels. A lack of music can result in increased stress and anxiety, potentially leading to higher blood pressure and heart rate.\n      * **Sleep Patterns**: Music, especially calming or soothing music, can aid in sleep. Its absence might disrupt sleep patterns, leading to insomnia or poor-quality sleep.\n   * **Behavioral Changes**:\n      * **Social Interaction**: Music often serves as a social lubricant, facilitating interactions and bonding. Without it, social interactions might feel less engaging and more strained.\n      * **Productivity**: Many people use music to enhance productivity, especially in repetitive or monotonous tasks. The absence of music can lead to decreased motivation and productivity."

Conversely, the absence of music therapy or regular musical engagement can result in the worsening of these conditions.\n2. **Impact on Dementia Patients**:\n   * Music has been found to have positive effects on patients with dementia, improving their mood, cognitive function, and social interaction. In environments where music therapy was withdrawn, a decline in these areas was observed.\n\n# Theoretical Background\n\nThe effects of music deprivation can be understood through several psychological and neurological frameworks:\n\n1. **Neurochemical Changes**:\n   * Music listening triggers the release of neurochemicals such as dopamine, which is associated with pleasure and reward. The lack of music can lead to reduced dopamine levels, affecting mood and motivation.\n2. **Cognitive and Emotional Processing**:\n   * Music activates multiple areas of the brain involved in emotional and cognitive processing. The absence of musical stimulation might result in decreased activation of these areas, affecting overall brain function."

I'm not saying it is, either. However, you claimed that a lack of music would make you go crazy after 30 days, and there is no evidence to support your claim. You made this up, or you heard it from someone else and because you're dumb, you believed it uncritically and are now repeating it without knowing if it's true.\n\nLots of things are good for your brain, but that doesn't mean abstaining from them will make you go crazy.  Puzzles are good for your brain.. but not doing a puzzle for 30 days won't make you lose your mind.\n\nI can think of hundreds of examples like this that you could never come up with on your own.\n\n>I told you I saw an more aggresive experiment \n\nNo you didn't. You're an idiot and a liar, a very common combination."

You can't stop people from being corrupt with legislation because the legislators themselves are corrupt. IMO the only option is to maximize individual freedom and opportunity so that when bad things happen people can bounce back on their feet fast. For extreme cases (such as unpaid earnings) we have civil courts."
