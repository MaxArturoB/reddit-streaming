If there was tons of money in a device to fully automate washing dishes (self loading and unloading) full laundry process etc, it would be far along in development right now. But even though it would be very helpful, there's very little money in that comparatively. \n\nCreating art can drive so much more investment because it is so much harder to do. It feels like much more of a leap in technology, even though it's shit at it, so it's driving much more of the technology and the imagination of where it can go, and therefor the money. Everyone can easily imagine the boundaries of where automated time saving machinery can go so it doesn't incite near as much investment"
