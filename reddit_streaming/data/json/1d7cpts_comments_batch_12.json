It\u2019s a false equivalency and just comes off as ignorant. A big part of why tech companies are so profitable is because of the relatively small overhead because they\u2019re mostly dealing with just information. It\u2019s almost like comparing Boston Dynamics and OpenAI. They\u2019re so different. What she\u2019s talking about would be a monumental leap. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re just targeting artists and writers, it\u2019s just easier for the technology to replicate that than to replicate manual labor. The idea that companies wouldn\u2019t want to get rid of the labor to do dishes and laundry and replace them with robots is silly. They\u2019d jump on it right now if it were that simple. And the idea that we should stop developing AI capabilities because it will replace certain jobs just comes off as scribes complaining about the Gutenberg press."

Like if someone wants to make a game by themselves, and has creative, innovative ideas for gameplay, story, and puzzles but doesn't have the skill for art, or finds background art tedious, or the game isn't even centered around the artstyle I can see them wanting it for that purpose.\n\nAnd obviously that's the case; people buy assets for that purpose exactly. Asset stores exist for this. Tons of great or successful games either started with incredibly basic assets, purchased assets, or straight up stolen assets (like Flappy Bird, fanmade mario games, etc). \n\nLikewise, it is similar to photography; a 5 year old taking a random snapshot is obviously different than a professional photographer creating art. But a 5 year old can create something that would be otherwise way beyond their art lvl. Artists definitely could, and do use AI art to create art. Photographers use generative fill, for example. Obviously there could be a way forward for people to still express creativity, using AI as a basis. It's just not happening much now because we're being flooded with low quality garbage trained on art that's not theirs, etc."
